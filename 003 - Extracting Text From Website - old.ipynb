On my recent visit there I had as guide a very intelligent native of Reineh who told me he had never heard any other name than Khurbet Kana, and whose answer to my question as to where was Kana el Jalil was \"In the gospel.\" Far more important is the testimony of the late Rev. T. Zeller of the Church Missionary Society, who passed many years in Nazareth, that he never heard such a name.

Holy Land Photographed  by Daniel B. Shepp. 1894 \\n Cana of  Galilee  ( Ancient Greek :  Κανὰ τῆς Γαλιλαίας ,  Arabic :  قانا الجليل \\u200e,  romanized :\\xa0 Qana al-Jalil ,  lit. \\xa0 \\'Qana of the Galilee\\') is the location of the  Marriage at Cana , at which the  miracle  of turning water into wine took place in the  Gospel of John . \\n The location is disputed, with the four primary locations being   Kafr Kanna ,  Khirbet Qana  and  Reineh  in  Lower Galilee  and  Qana  in  Upper Galilee . The Arabic name \"Qana al-Jalil\" has been said to apply to a number of sites, but is of doubtful authenticity. [1] \\nThe name possibly derives from the  Hebrew  or  Aramaic  word for  reeds .

Although none of the  synoptic gospels  record the event, mainstream Christian tradition holds that this is the first public miracle of Jesus. [3] \\n The other biblical references to Cana are also in John:  John 4:46 , which mentions that Jesus is visiting Cana when he is asked to heal the son of a royal official at  Capernaum ; and  John 21:2 , where it is mentioned that  Nathanael  (sometimes identified with the  Bartholomew  included in the synoptic gospels\\' lists of apostles) comes from Cana. [4] \\n The  Book of Joshua  mentions one city ( 19:28 ) and one brook ( 16:8 ;  17:9 ) named Kanah (Cana) – neither is likely to be the Cana of Galilee. [4] \\n \\n Other references [ edit ] \\n In secular history, the  annals  of Assyrian king  Tiglath-Pileser III , who conquered the Galilee in a 733 BC campaign, contain a badly preserved list of cities [5]  that had been thought to mention a certain  Kana . [6] [7]  It relates that six hundred fifty  captives were taken there. However, a revised transliteration revealed the one well-preserved syllable to be  Ku , not  Ka . [8] \\n Flavius Josephus  mentions more than one place named Cana. [2] [9]  In the context of the Galilee, there are two mentions in his  Life : one is a place on the road from  Iulias , [10]  and the other is a place where he resided, about a day\\'s walk from  Tiberias . [2] [11] \\n \\n Locating Cana [ edit ] \\n   Map of the  Lower Galilee  with possible locations of Cana:   Kafr Kanna , blue;  Khirbet Qana , red. \\n There has been much speculation about where Cana might have been. In his Gospel, the author makes no claim to have been at the wedding. Many would regard the story of the wedding at Cana as of theological rather than historical or topographical significance; it is the first of the seven miraculous  \"signs\"  by which Jesus\\'s divine status is attested, and around which the gospel is structured.\\n The consensus of modern scholarship is that the Fourth Gospel was addressed to a group of Jewish Christians, and very possibly a group living in  Judea province ; so it is unlikely that the evangelist would have mentioned a place that did not exist. [ citation needed ]  There is a minority view that the gospel was written for a  gentile  audience, and those who take this view assert that the description in the passage about the marriage at Cana of \"six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification\", which does not reflect good knowledge of the actual  ritual washing habits  among Jews at the time, is specifically for a gentile audience, who would not know the topography of the Holy Land. On this hypothesis, the name \"Cana\" might have some purely symbolic significance. [ citation needed ] \\n There are four primary locations which have been under consideration as the New Testament Cana: [12] \\n \\n Upper Galilee \\n Qana ,  Lebanon \\n Lower Galilee \\n Kafr Kanna ,  Israel  (also spelled Kefar Kenna)\\n Karm er-Ras, the western part of Kafr Kanna [13] \\n Khirbet Qana ,  Israel \\n Ain Qana ,  Israel \\n Qana, Lebanon [ edit ] \\n The village of  Qana , about 18 miles (29\\xa0km) from  Tyre, Lebanon , is traditionally held to be the correct site by many Christians, and is Eusebius\\'s pick in his 4th century  Onomasticon . [2] [14] [15]  In times of peace, it is a popular tourist site commemorating the miracle. [16] \\n \\n Kafr Kanna and Karm er-Ras [ edit ] \\n The first time this site is associated with New Testament Cana is in a mid-17th century report to the Pope by  Francesco Quaresimo , the papal emissary to Palestine, where he noted there were two possible candidates: Khirbet Qana and Kafr Kanna. [17]  According to the  Catholic Encyclopedia , a tradition dating back to the 8th century [18]  identifies Cana with the modern  Arab  town of  Kafr Kanna , at the foot of the Nazareth range, about 7 kilometres (4.3\\xa0mi) northeast of  Nazareth .\\n Some scholars believe, according to archaeological evidence, that the identification of Kafr Kanna was the result of the decline of Khirbet Qana beginning in the  Mamluk  period. They note that it was a common practice for new and more affluent and easily accessible sites to be established in place of old ones to accommodate increases in pilgrim traffic, particularly in the late Medieval and Ottoman periods. [17] \\n Karm er-Ras, the western part of Kafr Kanna, was recently excavated by Israeli archaeologist  Yardenna Alexandre . [13]  The excavation revealed evidence of a substantial Roman village with a Jewish population which declined considerably in the Late Roman period, and which was finally abandoned in the Byzantine Period, explaining why the pilgrim route was shifted to Kafr Kanna. Alexandre believes the site is precisely identified by Josephus, but other scholars disagree. [16] \\n \\n Khirbet Kana, Israel [ edit ] \\n Another possible candidate is the ruined village of  Khirbet Qana , meaning \"the ruins of Cana.\" Overlooking the  Beit Netofa Valley  from the north, it is located about 9 kilometres (5.6\\xa0mi) north of Kafr Kanna and has been noticed by pilgrims since the 12th century or earlier. [19]  However, this could either be an ancient retention, as  Edward Robinson  maintained, [19]  or may have been attached to the place in conversation with querying pilgrims. [2] \\n This site is located on a limestone outcropping that rises 330 feet (100\\xa0m) above the floor of the Bet Netofa Valley, 8 miles (13\\xa0km) from  Nazareth  and 5 miles (8.0\\xa0km) northeast of  Sepphoris  in lower Galilee. It also has long been identified as the true location of New Testament Cana. Excavations by archaeologist Douglas Edwards of the  University of Puget Sound  and archaeologist Tom McCollough reveal architectural and  numismatic  remains demonstrating that the site contained a modest-sized village from the  Hellenistic period  onward (c. 200 BCE–650 CE), including a structure that bears similarities to Roman-period synagogues, and several  mikveh  pools for Jewish ceremonial bathing. [20]  Most importantly, they uncovered a cave complex on the south slope of the site that showed indications of use as a center for worship, including a  sarcophagus  lid or altar and a shelf that held two stone vessels  in situ , and space for another four vessels, suggesting that Khirbet Kana was regarded as New Testament Cana from a very early time. Remains of an Arab village and a church or monastery were also uncovered immediately south of the cave complex. [ citation needed ] \\n Other historical evidence from the Byzantine and Medieval periods show that Khirbet Kana was regarded as the true site of New Testament Cana from a very early period. A guidebook written by Theodosius between 517 and 527 CE titled  The Layout of the Holy Land  identifies Khirbet Kana and indicates that two of the vessels were still at the location. A pilgrim account written by  Saewulf  in 1101 to 1103 CE also identifies the site, as do  Belard of Ascoli  (c. 1155 CE) and Dominican friar  Burchard of Mount Sion  (1283 CE), and a map by noted cartographer  Petrus Vesconte  in 1321 CE. Burchard of Mount Sion describes a cave complex located there that was used as a veneration site: \"the place is shown at this day where the six water pots stood, and the dining-room where the tables were placed.\" [20] \\n \\n Reineh, Israel [ edit ] \\n   Reineh  in the 1870  PEF Survey of Palestine , showing Ain Kana, identified by  Claude Reignier Conder  as the location of biblical Cana. [21] \\n Just south of the town of  Reineh , about a mile from  Nazareth , a small spring named \"Ain Kana\" was identified in 1878 by  Claude Reignier Conder  as the location of Cana. [21]  Some early Christian pilgrim reports mention a spring in association with the Cana of Galilee, but no excavations have been conducted there yet. [16]  Ain Qana is considered by some to be a better candidate based on  etymological  grounds.

      " This article is about a place mentioned in the New Testament. For other uses, see  Cana (disambiguation) .   Cana of  Galilee  ( Ancient Greek :  Κανὰ τῆς Γαλιλαίας ,  Arabic :  قانا الجليل ‎,  romanized :  Qana al-Jalil ,  lit.   'Qana of the Galilee') is the location of the  Marriage at Cana , at which the  miracle  of turning water into wine took place in the  Gospel of John .   The location is disputed, with the four primary locations being   Kafr Kanna ,  Khirbet Qana  and  Reineh  in  Lower Galilee  and  Qana  in  Upper Galilee . The Arabic name \"Qana al-Jalil\" has been said to apply to a number of sites, but is of doubtful authenticity. [1]     Cana is very positively located in  Shepherd's Historical Atlas , 1923: modern scholars are less sure.   Among Christians and other students of the  New Testament , Cana is best known as the place where, according to the  Fourth Gospel ,  Jesus  performed \"the first of his signs\", his first public  miracle , the turning of a large quantity of water into wine at a wedding feast ( John 2:1–11 ) when the wine provided by the bridegroom had run out. Although none of the  synoptic gospels  record the event, mainstream Christian tradition holds that this is the first public miracle of Jesus. [3]   The other biblical references to Cana are also in John:  John 4:46 , which mentions that Jesus is visiting Cana when he is asked to heal the son of a royal official at  Capernaum ; and  John 21:2 , where it is mentioned that  Nathanael  (sometimes identified with the  Bartholomew  included in the synoptic gospels' lists of apostles) comes from Cana. [4]   The  Book of Joshua  mentions one city ( 19:28 ) and one brook ( 16:8 ;  17:9 ) named Kanah (Cana) – neither is likely to be the Cana of Galilee. [4]   In secular history, the  annals  of Assyrian king  Tiglath-Pileser III , who conquered the Galilee in a 733 BC campaign, contain a badly preserved list of cities [5]  that had been thought to mention a certain  Kana . [6] [7]  It relates that six hundred fifty  captives were taken there. However, a revised transliteration revealed the one well-preserved syllable to be  Ku , not  Ka . [8]   Flavius Josephus  mentions more than one place named Cana. [2] [9]  In the context of the Galilee, there are two mentions in his  Life : one is a place on the road from  Iulias , [10]  and the other is a place where he resided, about a day's walk from  Tiberias . [2] [11]     Map of the  Lower Galilee  with possible locations of Cana:   Kafr Kanna , blue;  Khirbet Qana , red.   There has been much speculation about where Cana might have been. In his Gospel, the author makes no claim to have been at the wedding. Many would regard the story of the wedding at Cana as of theological rather than historical or topographical significance; it is the first of the seven miraculous  \"signs\"  by which Jesus's divine status is attested, and around which the gospel is structured.  The consensus of modern scholarship is that the Fourth Gospel was addressed to a group of Jewish Christians, and very possibly a group living in  Judea province ; so it is unlikely that the evangelist would have mentioned a place that did not exist. [ citation needed ]  There is a minority view that the gospel was written for a  gentile  audience, and those who take this view assert that the description in the passage about the marriage at Cana of \"six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification\", which does not reflect good knowledge of the actual  ritual washing habits  among Jews at the time, is specifically for a gentile audience, who would not know the topography of the Holy Land. On this hypothesis, the name \"Cana\" might have some purely symbolic significance. [ citation needed ]   There are four primary locations which have been under consideration as the New Testament Cana: [12]   The village of  Qana , about 18 miles (29 km) from  Tyre, Lebanon , is traditionally held to be the correct site by many Christians, and is Eusebius's pick in his 4th century  Onomasticon . [2] [14] [15]  In times of peace, it is a popular tourist site commemorating the miracle. [16]   The first time this site is associated with New Testament Cana is in a mid-17th century report to the Pope by  Francesco Quaresimo , the papal emissary to Palestine, where he noted there were two possible candidates: Khirbet Qana and Kafr Kanna. [17]  According to the  Catholic Encyclopedia , a tradition dating back to the 8th century [18]  identifies Cana with the modern  Arab  town of  Kafr Kanna , at the foot of the Nazareth range, about 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) northeast of  Nazareth .  Some scholars believe, according to archaeological evidence, that the identification of Kafr Kanna was the result of the decline of Khirbet Qana beginning in the  Mamluk  period. They note that it was a common practice for new and more affluent and easily accessible sites to be established in place of old ones to accommodate increases in pilgrim traffic, particularly in the late Medieval and Ottoman periods. [17]   Karm er-Ras, the western part of Kafr Kanna, was recently excavated by Israeli archaeologist  Yardenna Alexandre . [13]  The excavation revealed evidence of a substantial Roman village with a Jewish population which declined considerably in the Late Roman period, and which was finally abandoned in the Byzantine Period, explaining why the pilgrim route was shifted to Kafr Kanna. Alexandre believes the site is precisely identified by Josephus, but other scholars disagree. [16]   Another possible candidate is the ruined village of  Khirbet Qana , meaning \"the ruins of Cana.\" Overlooking the  Beit Netofa Valley  from the north, it is located about 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) north of Kafr Kanna and has been noticed by pilgrims since the 12th century or earlier. [19]  However, this could either be an ancient retention, as  Edward Robinson  maintained, [19]  or may have been attached to the place in conversation with querying pilgrims. [2]   This site is located on a limestone outcropping that rises 330 feet (100 m) above the floor of the Bet Netofa Valley, 8 miles (13 km) from  Nazareth  and 5 miles (8.0 km) northeast of  Sepphoris  in lower Galilee. It also has long been identified as the true location of New Testament Cana. Excavations by archaeologist Douglas Edwards of the  University of Puget Sound  and archaeologist Tom McCollough reveal architectural and  numismatic  remains demonstrating that the site contained a modest-sized village from the  Hellenistic period  onward (c. 200 BCE–650 CE), including a structure that bears similarities to Roman-period synagogues, and several  mikveh  pools for Jewish ceremonial bathing. [20]  Most importantly, they uncovered a cave complex on the south slope of the site that showed indications of use as a center for worship, including a  sarcophagus  lid or altar and a shelf that held two stone vessels  in situ , and space for another four vessels, suggesting that Khirbet Kana was regarded as New Testament Cana from a very early time. Remains of an Arab village and a church or monastery were also uncovered immediately south of the cave complex. [ citation needed ]   Other historical evidence from the Byzantine and Medieval periods show that Khirbet Kana was regarded as the true site of New Testament Cana from a very early period. A guidebook written by Theodosius between 517 and 527 CE titled  The Layout of the Holy Land  identifies Khirbet Kana and indicates that two of the vessels were still at the location. A pilgrim account written by  Saewulf  in 1101 to 1103 CE also identifies the site, as do  Belard of Ascoli  (c. 1155 CE) and Dominican friar  Burchard of Mount Sion  (1283 CE), and a map by noted cartographer  Petrus Vesconte  in 1321 CE. Burchard of Mount Sion describes a cave complex located there that was used as a veneration site: \"the place is shown at this day where the six water pots stood, and the dining-room where the tables were placed.\" [20]     Reineh  in the 1870  PEF Survey of Palestine , showing Ain Kana, identified by  Claude Reignier Conder  as the location of biblical Cana. [21]   Just south of the town of  Reineh , about a mile from  Nazareth , a small spring named \"Ain Kana\" was identified in 1878 by  Claude Reignier Conder  as the location of Cana. [21]  Some early Christian pilgrim reports mention a spring in association with the Cana of Galilee, but no excavations have been conducted there yet. [16]  Ain Qana is considered by some to be a better candidate based on  etymological  grounds.

Were this the universal custom it would no doubt be an important confirmation of this view, but this is far from being the case; indeed, such a name is unknown to the unsophisticated fellahin. On my recent visit there I had as guide a very intelligent native of Reineh who told me he had never heard any other name than Khurbet Kana, and whose answer to my question as to where was Kana el Jalil was \"In the gospel.\" Far more important is the testimony of the late Rev.

    "This shows that I read and labeled 2,605 articles about Biblical archeology. These are the articles that my web crawler pulled from Google in relation to Biblical archeology and the nations mentioned in the Bible. Of these, I felt like 491 were relevant to the topic of Biblical archeology. I felt like the others were tangental, i.e. sermon notes that mention Biblical archeology but added nothing to the topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Labeling this data is a likely source of noise. While I tried very hard to be consistent in my labeling, this process took hundreds of hours in an effort that lasted nearly half a year. Since this effort was stretched out across such a long time period, there is every reason to believe that I may have inconsistently labeled sites. In an attempt to control for this, once I read and labeled the entire list, I reread all of the relevant articles and decided again whether or not they were truly relevant. Unfortunately, I did not have time to reread all of the non-relevant articles to form a second opinion. I'm somewhat interested in seeing which non-relevant articles my predictive model will classify as relevant and how relevant they actually are. The worst possible outcome would be if there is so much noise that my model cannot accurately classify relevant articles. If it inaccurately classifies non-relevant articles, I can always read those and make an informed decision. If it inaccurately classifies relevant articles, these are simply lost."
