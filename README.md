# Bible-Research
Using the Bible as a subject to increase my skills in python, machine learning and text analytics.

I am interested in increasing my skills in python, machine learning and text analytics. The best way to do this, in my opinion, is to pick a topic and dive in. I picked the Bible because it is important to me, personally, and because it contains a lot of text. There are also a ton of blogs, books and other sources of information online related to the Bible, which means there should be a lot of opportunities to explore various data types and techniques. 

I will try to add the most helpful site(s) to the code as I search for solutions to difficult problems.
